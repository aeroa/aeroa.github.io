SPaircraft is a signomial programming compatible transonic aircraft conceptual design optimization tool. It is of similar level of fidelity as TASOPT, and can perform the single- and multi-mission optimization of different configurations of aircraft. The most notable of these are conventional tube-and-wing aircraft, and the D8 double bubble aircraft, which promises dramatic fuel burn benefits over the conventional configuration.

As part of the 16.82 Flight Vehicle Engineering Capstone course at MIT, GPkit is being used for design optimization of a long-endurance, medium altitude unmanned aircraft, whose mission is to provide communications coverage to areas affected by natural disasters or other scenarios.

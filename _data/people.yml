    bio: Martin York is a Master’s candidate in the Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering department at MIT. His research focuses on using signomial programming for aircraft conceptual design optimization. He is a member of the Hoburg Research Group’s D8 team, where he is working with Aurora Flight Sciences to perform a sensitivity and scaling analysis of the D8 aircraft concept. Martin is a cadet in Air Force ROTC and will commission into the Air Force, where he hopes to pursue a career as a pilot, upon completion of his Master’s degree.

    bio: Ali received a BE in Mechanical Engineering and a BS in Mathematics from the American University of Beirut (AUB) in 2016. As an undergraduate, he was a member of the Microfluidics lab and worked on designing a surface tension actuated micropump. In his final year project, he used stochastic sampling to design fast algorithms for inverse particle tracking in stochastic flow fields. He was a visiting student at MIT in the Aerospace Computational Design Laboratory (ACDL), and worked with the Uncertainty Quantification Group on implementing the mathematical model of the sap exudation in maple trees using MUQ, and then inferring the uncertain inputs to that model using MCMC methods. In 2016, he began his MS in Computations for Design and Optimization at MIT, and is currently working on Robust Geometric Programming formulations.

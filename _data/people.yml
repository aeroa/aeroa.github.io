    bio: Ali Saab began his MS in Computations for Design and Optimization at MIT in 2016,
      and is currently working on Robust Geometric Programming formulations.
      He received a BE in Mechanical Engineering and a BS in Mathematics from the American University of Beirut (AUB) in 2016.
      As an undergraduate, he was a member of the Microfluidics lab and worked on designing a surface tension actuated micropump,
      and used stochastic sampling to design fast algorithms for inverse particle tracking in stochastic flow fields.
      He was a visiting student in the Aerospace Computational Design Laboratory,
      and worked with the Uncertainty Quantification Group on implementing a model of the sap exudation in maple trees using MUQ,
      and inferring the uncertain inputs to that model using MCMC methods.

    webpage:
    bio: Arthur Brown's research interests are primarily in clean-sheet design of innovative aircraft concepts,
      and he is currently working on projects relating to the design and optimization of electric aircraft.
      In the Computational Aerodynamics Lab at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies,
      Arthur used high-fidelity Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes aerodynamic shape optimization
      to redesign a series of airliner wings to burn less fuel by flying lower and more slowly.
      He also worked for a year as an aerodynamicist with Blue Sky Solar Racing, the University of Toronto solar car racing team,
      and for a summer in the same capacity with U of T's Human-Powered Vehicle Design Team.
      In 2015, he became the first ever Canadian student to win the AIAA Aircraft Design Competition,
      with an entry in the Undergraduate Individual category; he placed second in the same contest in 2016.
      In his spare time, Arthur is an avid fisherman; he also enjoys long-distance running, basketball, military history, and chess.

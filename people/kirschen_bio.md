Philippe is a graduate of the Hoburg Research Group, having received his
Master's degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2016. Although he loves
finding global optima, the focus of Philippe's  research was the use of
signomial programming for aircraft design optimization.  During his time at
MIT, he was a recipient of the NASA Aeronautics Fellowship. Philippe
currently works as an Optimization Engineer for Hyperloop One, where he is
actively and enthusiastically using GPkit, whilst trying (and failing) not to
sound too preachy about how awesome geometric programming is.  Outside of using
powerful optimization techniques, Philippe enjoys rowing, cycling,
snowboarding, and petting strangers' dogs.

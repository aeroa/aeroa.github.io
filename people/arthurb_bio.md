Arthur received a Bachelor's degree in Engineering Science from the University of Toronto in 2016, majoring in Aerospace Engineering. As an undergraduate, he spent a summer working in the Computational Aerodynamics Lab at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS). Using high-fidelity Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes aerodynamic shape optimization, he successfully redesigned a series of airliner wings to burn less fuel by flying lower and more slowly. He also worked for a year as an aerodynamicist with Blue Sky Solar Racing, the University of Toronto solar car racing team; and for a summer in the same capacity with U of T's Human-Powered Vehicle Design Team. In 2015, he became the first ever Canadian student to win the AIAA Aircraft Design Competition, with an entry in the Undergraduate Individual category; he placed second in the same contest in 2016. He is now a Master's candidate in Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT. His research interests are primarily in clean-sheet design of innovative aircraft concepts, and he is currently working on projects relating to the design and optimization of electric aircraft. In his spare time, Arthur is an avid fisherman; he also enjoys long-distance running, basketball, military history, and chess.

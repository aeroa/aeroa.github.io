title: Net Present Value Model
author: mjburton

In finance, the net present value (NPV) is a measurement of profitability calculated by subtracting the present values (PV) of cash outflows (including initial cost) from the present values of cash inflows over a period of time. Incoming and outgoing cash flows can also be described as benefit and cost cash flows, respectively.

[A model for maximizing net-present-value](https://github.com/hoburg/gpkit-models/blob/master/gpkitmodels/npv/) has been added to the GPkit model library. We hope you find it useful, and welcome any feedback.

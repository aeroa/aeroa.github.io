The single-mission optimization has over 1700 free variables, and solves in under 10 seconds, giving vast speed improvements over aircraft multidisciplinary design tools (TASOPT performs the same optimization in XXXX seconds). 

Demonstrated advantages include the ability to easily evaluate different aircraft configurations and the ability to reliably change objective functions. Whenan SP is solved, both the optimal point and the sensitivity of the optimal cost to all parameters are found. These values provide valuable design intuition and direction for future modeling enhancements.

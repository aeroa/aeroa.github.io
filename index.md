**We use convex optimization to rethink the engineering design process.** Convexity helps teams develop a deep understanding of system tradeoffs by providing mathematical guarantees and solving for thousands of decision variables in seconds. In our modeling framework [gpkit], convexity also serves as a shared design language. This Convex Engineering approach was integral to the conception and design of the [MIT Jungle Hawk Owl](http://news.mit.edu/2017/drones-stay-aloft-five-days-0607).  Our tools are used at Aurora Flight Sciences for NASAâ€™s D8 and LEARN3 initiatives as well as at Airbus, Hyperloop One, Shell Oil and Google \[x\].

We incorporate new insights and algorithms into these tools as patterns of their use mature. Additionally we maintain an [open-source library of reusable models][gplibrary].
If you have any questions, or would like to get involved, [send us an email](mailto:gpkit@mit.edu)!

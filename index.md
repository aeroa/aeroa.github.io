# Convex Engineering Group

**We use convex optimization to rethink the engineering design process.**
 What length of night can a solar airplane fly through, and how does this depend on the weight of its sensors? Engineering requires understanding tradeoffs across possible designs.
When wingspan, altitude, and the thousands of other design decisions are represented as variables subject to convex constraints, mathematics of convexity let the boundary of tradeoffs and possibilities be mapped in seconds.
Our [GPkit] modeling framework uses this to help design teams explore engineering possibilities and agree on fundamental tradeoffs.

GPkit was integral to the concept and sizing of the  [MIT Jungle Hawk Owl](http://news.mit.edu/2017/drones-stay-aloft-five-days-0607), an unmanned aircraft designed to stay aloft for five days,
and is in active use at Aurora Flight Sciences, Airbus, Hyperloop One, Shell Oil and Google \[x\].
To use it yourself, see the [documentation](http://gpkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted.html) or [model library][GPlibrary].

### Our Research is Open Source
We incorporate new insights and algorithms into our tools, develop reusable subsystem models, and combine the two to explore interesting engineering systems.
If you have any questions or would like to be involved, [send us an email](mailto:gpkit@mit.edu)!

**We use convex optimization to rethink the engineering design process.** The mathematical structure of convexity lets thousands of decision variables be solved with formal guarantees in seconds. Our modeling framework [gpkit] builds on this, using convexity as a shared design language that lets engineering teams construct an understanding of system tradeoffs that arises from their fundamental physics. This methodology was integral to the conception and prototyping of the [MIT Jungle Hawk Owl](http://news.mit.edu/2017/drones-stay-aloft-five-days-0607), and is in active use at Aurora Flight Sciences (for NASAâ€™s D8 and LEARN3 initiatives), Airbus, Hyperloop One, Shell Oil and Google \[x\].

We work to incorporate new insights and algorithms into these tools as patterns of their use mature, and to develop and maintain [open-source reusable engineering models.][gplibrary]
